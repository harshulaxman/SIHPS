## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
Develop a user-centric software solution that empowers
individuals to responsibly dispose of e-waste. Our platform
combines precise location-based services to find the nearest ewaste collection and recycling facilities with engaging
educational content on e-waste's environmental and health
impacts. Users can input their old device models to estimate
precious metal recovery and earn redeemable credits. To
maximize user benefits, we offer a versatile rewards program,
allowing users to redeem credits for discounts, eco-friendly
products, or donations to environmental causes. Our goal is to
create an interactive and sustainable ecosystem that motivates
and educates users while making a meaningful impact on ewaste reduction and environmental preservation.
